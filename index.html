            Let's go over some ground rules. The objective of this game is to guess the hidden number in 4 or less tries. Reflect on your most recent tarot reading and consult a fortune cookie, cause it's time to select a number to input into the field. This lovely program will inform you if your guess was too high or too low. When you inevitably experience failure, please try again!
